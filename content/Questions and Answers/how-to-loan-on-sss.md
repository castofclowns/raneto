SSS or Social Security System is the Philippine government’s social insurance program for workers. It provides health and retirement benefits to those enrolled Filipino workers. Those that are self-employed can also be enrolled via voluntary registration.
After the registration, workers can get to apply for a salary loan. Members can loan for a 1 month’s or 2 month’s salary. Salary loans are to be paid within a two year period. Prior to your application, you need an employment certification. Today, applications have been made easier through their online registration. If you want to know further how to loan on SSS, just follow the simple steps below:

Step 1. Sign up at sss.gov.ph. Choose a username and password that you can easily remember to avoid unnecessary reset requests.

Step 2. Sign In. Should your first attempt to log-in fails, you will have to wait for about 20 to 30 minutes and try again. You may also wait for the verification email from SSS.

Step 3. Go to Salary Loan Transaction. Scroll down and click Transactions. Then, select Salary Loan.

Step 4. Set the amount you intend to loan.
*	When you’re ready, check the box with "I agree to the terms and conditions." Then choose Proceed. The maximum allowable loan amount is PHP 30,000, but you may also use the drop down menu to choose a lower amount.

Step 5. View Disclosure and Submit.
*	See the "Disclosure Statement” on Loan/Credit Transaction. Save that and then click Submit. The disclosure statement has the details of your loan amount, other deductions / charges, interest fees, and payment schedule.
* It would take 2 to 3 weeks from the submission date to receive the check. Depending on where you are working, your human resources team can send you an email to inform you where you could claim the check.
