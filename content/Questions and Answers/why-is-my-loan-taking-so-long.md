Obviously, there are some reasons that are holding back your loan application. The processing would take a bit longer than what you’ve expected. Knowing and understanding the reasons would save you from fretting.

**Internal coordination**
The loan processing passes through several hands that can cause backlog. The internal coordination is important, and it doesn’t only involve the processing team, but also the settlement and underwriting team.

**Inflow of loan applications**
Despite the fact that getting loans involves higher interest rate, still many people prefer using it. Thus, another reason that takes your loan so long is the inflow of loan application. Many loan applicants draw in when the rates drop. This would mean longer processing time particularly if your loan application is piled underneath.

**Document verification**
The processing of loan would take so long as caused by document verification. Therefore, it’s important to ensure that all the documents required are submitted and the references should be accessible and easy to contact.
To speed up the processing of your loan application, you should always be available because the lender may request for additional information. Thus, you should be prepared to answer questions pertaining to your employment history, income source, and many others. Why is my loan taking so long? With all those information cited above, your question is presumably answered.
