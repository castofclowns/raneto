**Monthly Amortization: (Approved Loan Amount / Number of months to pay) + (Approved Loan Amount * Interest Rate).**

Example:

For the sake of computation:

Approved Amount: 100,000
Terms: 36 months
Interest Rate: 1.5%

(Approved Loan Amount / Number of months to pay) + (Approved Loan Amount * Interest Rate)
(100,000 / 36 mos) + (100,000 * 1.5%)
2777.78 + 1500 = 4277.78 per month in 36 months
