As above-mentioned, the requirements are set by your matched lender. This means applicant A may have different requirements from applicant B.

Additional requirements maybe asked from you if deemed necessary to showcase your capability of repaying the loan. After all, what the lender needs is assurance of being paid and to earn.

Additional requirement would also mean requiring a collateral and/or a co-maker.
