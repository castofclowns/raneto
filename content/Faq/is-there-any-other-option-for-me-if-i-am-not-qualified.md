**Should you think you are not qualified to process a loan, please consider these two options:**

1. **Ask a relative or friend who are qualified (assess according to the requirements) to apply loan in your behalf.**
	* He/she should be able to submit the required documents under her /his name. You can just negotiate on the payment terms with them after the loan is approved.
	* especially if you are an OFW abroad, you cannot let your relative submit your requirements because you are not in the Philippines. Your relative who will apply in your behalf should apply and submit requirements under their name.

	Example:
	* Applicant A is not qualified
	* Applicant B is qualified and apply in behalf of Applicant A
	* Applicant B will apply with Applicant B's information
	* If approved, Applicant B gets the loan proceed
	* Agreement with Applicant A and B who consumes the loan proceed
	* Applicant B should be the one to ensure repayment of the loan regardless if the fund is coming from Applicant A or B
